\section{Database design}
One of my main focuses was helping design the database, we worked as a group to not only understand what data was needed, but why it was structured the way it was.  I have a fair amount of experience not only with database class, but with work I interact with a database on a regular basis.  Good database design is key to an efficient working project.  We spent a good portion of our time working on the design of the database making sure it made sense and allowed for ease of data access.

\section{GIT}
I worked closely with the group on organizing git hub and helping with merging the project.  Although we ran into many issue with merging our project.  I am walking away from this project with a great deal more knowledge about how git hub works.  Knowing how VS built the project, we should have only pushed the Views, Models and Controllers.  This would have saved from many hassles of merge conflicts.

\section{Employee/Customer Views}
I built out the Employee and customer views.  Although there are modifications with these views I would like to make to them, I learned a great deal about how the project is structured.  I also customized the action buttons to condense into a single drop down to allow for compacting the view and de cluttering the entire page.
