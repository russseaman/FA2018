# School GITHUB
Class folders
This is a collection of all of my classes sorted by semster into folders, since I learned github.

**Please Note: I will break off special projects into seperate project repos for examples.

Learning outcomes (What I learned):


1.) Basic use of github, with use of push/pull/fetch/commits/clone.

2.) Project management with use of file structuring.
